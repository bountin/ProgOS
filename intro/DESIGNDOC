			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added to the struct start_aux_data:

	char *args /* The complete arguments string */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

My code creates two stacks: One is the final user program stack which
starts on the bottom of the page and grows up. The argument vectors'
content is put there. Then there is a second one which grows from the
beginning of the page towards its end. All pointers to the argument
vectors go there. After the tokenization of the arguments the second
stack is copied on the first stack and the remaining data is put on
it (**argv, argc, fake return address).

Overflowing is prevented by counting the length of both stacks,
adding some extra space for the remaining data (see above) and 
checking this after each argument. If there is an overflow setup_stack()
returns false but it could be easily implemented that longer stacks are 
possible by adding another page(s) behind the first one and filling them
too.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

Because strtok() is not thread-safe and strtok_r() is.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.



			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

The process part is challenging but I think that the level is just fine
for a optional course ;-)

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

The thread switching part with the swapping return addresses was one of
the parts that I found interesting and that was new to me too.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

A calling example with parameters given for hex_dump() would be great.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
